    <!-- Replace this text with your description of the project -->
    <p class="description">The WorldSurf surfing competition is the best one you will see in Hawaii in terms of talent, entertainment, and overall experience. The competition features 32 surfers who have qualified for the competition. There is a bracket that will have the contestants in order by a number of factors. The WorldSurf competition is 3 days long and will get only more intense as the days pass. Each contestant will have 3 runs in each round and the contestant with the highest score at the end of each round will move onto the next round. The finalists will have 5 runs in order to show the judges what they've got. The grand prize is $1 million, the highest of any surfing competition. </p>
    <p class="description">This year will be the 50th anniversary of the largest surfing competition in Hawaii. We will have every surfing legend you can think of here on the island taking part in the competition either as a judge, participant, or a spectator. We will have music guests such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Chance the Rapper, Kanye West, and Jack U. There will be a raffle draw at the end of each day for some cool prizes. You won't want to miss the biggest year yet.</p>
